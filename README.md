# SATD
# Self Admitted Technical Debt 
# Source code comments
Source code comments are explanation or annotation that written by the developers, comments allow developers to clarify, document, and express concerns about the implementation in an informal method that does not influence the functionality of the program, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters..


# Commits messages
Commits messages are the express of action that the developers made on the source code and document this action with semantic commits


# Technical debt
is a metaphor, coined by Ward Cunningham . It reflects the additional cost that imply to rework caused by a sup-optimal solution instead of using the better approach in software development life cycle. The concept of TD is derived from financial debt, as the Interest resulting from the late payment. Similar to the financial dept, TD has an interest and the cost increases if not pay the debt early, by refactoring the code on the suitable time, to avoid interest in the future.

# The Goal
This project was built to classify the comments and commits messages written by the developer,  intent to using NLP to automation identification the Technical debt from both the comments and commits.
